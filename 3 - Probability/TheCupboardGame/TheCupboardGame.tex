\subsection{The Cupboard Game}

I found this problem on Reddit and like many good probability problems, the usual intuition is wrong. In hindsight I should have verified my intuition by explicit calculation, but I was lazy and did not bother so got it wrong. I rate this a 4/10 in difficulty, although I doubt anyone would get the answer to this very fast.

There are eight cupboards arranged in two rows of four columns as shown below. Inside a randomly chosen cupboard there is a prize and Alice and Bob play a game to determine who gets the prize. Alice opens cupboards going along the rows first, so in order $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, $H$. Bob opens cupboards going along the columns first, so in order $A$, $E$, $B$, $F$, $C$, $G$, $D$, $H$. Both open cupboard doors at the same time and if the the prize is inside a cupboard they have both picked simultaneously then it is a tie. Is one of them more likely to win, and if so, who?
