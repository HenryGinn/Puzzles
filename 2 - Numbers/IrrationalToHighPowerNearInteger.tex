\subsection{Irrational to High Power Near Integer}

This problem was given to me by my Oxford admissions preparation tutor, Jeremy. The original problem he gave was ``what happens, now prove it", to which I found the first part, but here I am revealing that information upfront. I came back to this problem in 2024 and solved it in around 20 minutes and I have provided this proof as the second solution. Dr Barker on YouTube also covered this problem and gave the much slicker argument which is given as the first solution. This problem benefits greatly from pen and paper, and is much more suited to the mathematically inclined. I rate this problem a 5 out of 10 in terms of difficulty.

$(1 + \sqrt{2})^n$ gets close to an integer when raised to a high power. Explain why this is the case. Extension question: characterise exactly which $a + \sqrt{b}$ where this occurs.
