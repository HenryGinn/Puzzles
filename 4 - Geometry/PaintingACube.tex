\subsection{Painting a Cube}

During my PGCE at King's College London we were given a simple 10 minute exercise given and then asked to look for extensions. Together with a friend, Amy, we found this extension that the course leader probably was not expecting. Having something to write with will help significantly for this problem, and the initial problem lends itself very well to an explorative approach.

A $4 \times 4 \times 4$ arrangement of cubees form a larger cube. The larger cube is then painted. The original question was to find how many cubees have exactly 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 faces painted. Find a formula for how many cubees have exactly $k$ painted faces when an $N^m$ hypercube is painted.
